# Multivariate-Market-Data-for-Financial-Trends

This project provides a **Google Colab-based financial data visualization tool** that enables analysts to **fetch, analyze, and visualize multivariate market data** to identify emerging financial trends. It uses Python libraries such as `yfinance`,`pandas`, and `plotly` to collect and visualize both **Historical** and **Real-Time** market data.

# Project Overview
Financial Analysts often need to explore **large, multivariate datasets** to detect meaningful patterns and market trends. 
This notebook:
- Acquires market data from **Yahoo Finance** using `yfinance`.
- Cleans and preprocesses the data for analysis.
- Generates **interactive visualizations** for price trends and correlations.
- Includes a **real-time streaming component** to simulate live market monitoring.

This entire project runs on **Google Colab**, requiring no installation on your machine.

# Objectives
- **Data Acquisition: **Collect Financial time-series data from public sources.
- **Data Processing: **Clean and structure the data for analysis.
- **Visualization: **Create simple but interactive charts to explore trends.
- **Real-Time Streaming: **Fetch and visualize live updates for tickers.
